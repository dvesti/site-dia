The following is a comparison of two search engines: lunr: simple, no need to synchronize index.json, no limit for contentLength, but high bandwidth and low performance (Especially for Chinese which needs a large segmentit library) algolia: high performance and low bandwidth, but need to synchronize index.json and limit for contentLength The content of the post is separated by h2 and h3 HTML tag to improve query performance and basically implement full-text search. contentLength is used to limit the max index length of the part starting with h2 and h3 HTML tag. Tips about algolia You need to upload index.json files to algolia to activate searching. You could upload the index.json files by browsers but a CLI tool may be better. Algolia Atomic is a good choice. To be compatible with Hugo multilingual mode, you need to upload different index.json for each language to the different index of algolia, such as zh-cn/index.json or fr/index.json… ","date":"06-03-2020","objectID":"/en/posts-old/theme-documentation-basics/:5:2","tags":["installation","configuration"],"title":"Theme Documentation - Basics","uri":"/en/posts-old/theme-documentation-basics/"},{"categories":["documentation"],"content":"Discover what the Hugo - CodeIT theme is all about and the core-concepts behind it.","date":"06-03-2020","objectID":"/en/2020/theme-documentation-basics/","tags":["installation","configuration"],"title":"Theme Documentation - Basics","uri":"/en/2020/theme-documentation-basics/"},{"categories":["documentation"],"content":"Discover what the Hugo - CodeIT theme is all about and the core-concepts behind it.

Tips about algolia You need to upload index.json files to algolia to activate searching. You could upload the index.json files by browsers but a CLI tool may be better.

Note This article is a shameful copy of the great Grav original page. If you want to know about the extented Markdown syntax of CodeIT theme, please read extended Markdown syntax page. Let’s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages. Markdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it. Some of the key benefits are: Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it’s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this: The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

Let’s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages. Markdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it. Some of the key benefits are: Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it’s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this: The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. – John Gruber Without further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like!

I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I’ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won’t cover using CSS to style your theme. We’ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template. Then we’ll add in a few pages and posts. With small variations on that, you will be able to create many different types of web sites. In this tutorial, commands that you enter will start with the “$” prompt. The output will follow. Lines that start with “#” are comments that I’ve added to explain a point. When I show updates to a file, the “:wq” on the last line means to save the file. Here’s an example: ## this is a comment $ echo this is a command this is a command ## edit the file $vi foo.md +++ date = \"2014-09-28\" title = \"creating a new theme\" +++ bah and humbug :wq ## show it $ cat foo.md +++ date = \"2014-09-28\" title = \"creating a new theme\" +++ bah and humbug $ ","date":"28-09-2014","objectID":"/en/posts-old/creating-a-new-theme/:1:0","tags":["themes"],"title":"Creating a New Theme","uri":"/en/posts-old/creating-a-new-theme/"},{"categories":["Blog"],"content":"Some Definitions There are a few concepts that you need to understand before creating a theme.

It’s the CSS that controls colors and fonts, it’s the Javascript that determines actions and reactions. It’s also the rules that Hugo uses to transform your content into the HTML that the site will serve to visitors. You have two ways to create a skin. The simplest way is to create it in the layouts/ directory. If you do, then you don’t have to worry about configuring Hugo to recognize it. The first place that Hugo will look for rules and files is in the layouts/ directory so it will always find the skin. Your second choice is to create it in a sub-directory of the themes/ directory. If you do, then you must always tell Hugo where to search for the skin. It’s extra work, though, so why bother with it? The difference between creating a skin in layouts/ and creating it in themes/ is very subtle. A skin in layouts/ can’t be customized without updating the templates and static files that it is built from. A skin created in themes/, on the other hand, can be and that makes it easier for other people to use it. The rest of this tutorial will call a skin created in the themes/ directory a theme. Note that you can use this tutorial to create a skin in the layouts/ directory if you wish to. The main difference will be that you won’t need to update the site’s configuration file to use a theme.

It is the index.html file in the root directory of the web site. Since Hugo writes files to the public/ directory, our home page is public/index.html.

The file can use TOML, YAML, or JSON. I prefer to use TOML for my configuration files. If you prefer to use JSON or YAML, you’ll need to translate my examples. You’ll also need to change the name of the file since Hugo uses the extension to determine how to process it. Hugo translates Markdown files into HTML. By default, Hugo expects to find Markdown files in your content/ directory and template files in your themes/ directory. It will create HTML files in your public/ directory. You can change this by specifying alternate locations in the configuration file.

The first section is the “front matter,” which is the meta-information on the content. The second section contains Markdown that will be converted to HTML. Front Matter The front matter is information about the content. Like the configuration file, it can be written in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Unlike the configuration file, Hugo doesn’t use the file’s extension to know the format. It looks for markers to signal the type. TOML is surrounded by “+++”, YAML by “---”, and JSON is enclosed in curly braces. I prefer to use TOML, so you’ll need to translate my examples if you prefer YAML or JSON. The information in the front matter is passed into the template before the content is rendered into HTML. Markdown Content is written in Markdown which makes it easier to create the content. Hugo runs the content through a Markdown engine to create the HTML which will be written to the output file.

Template files are a bridge between the content and presentation. Rules in the template define what content is published, where it’s published to, and how it will rendered to the HTML file. The template guides the presentation by specifying the style to use. There are three types of templates: single, list, and partial. Each type takes a bit of content as input and transforms it based on the commands in the template. Hugo uses its knowledge of the content to find the template file used to render the content. If it can’t find a template that is an exact match for the content, it will shift up a level and search from there. It will continue to do so until it finds a matching template or runs out of templates to try. If it can’t find a template, it will use the default template for the site. Please note that you can use the front matter to influence Hugo’s choice of templates. Single Template A single template is used to render a single piece of content. For example, an article or post would be a single piece of content and use a single template. List Template A list template renders a group of related content. That could be a summary of recent postings or all articles in a category. List templates can contain multiple groups. The homepage template is a special type of list template. Hugo assumes that the home page of your site will act as the portal for the rest of the content in the site. Partial Template A partial template is a template that can be included in other templates. Partial templates must be called using the “partial” template command. They are very handy for rolling up common behavior. For example, your site may have a banner that all pages use. Instead of copying the text of the banner into every single and list template, you could create a partial with the banner in it. That way if you decide to change the banner, you only have to change the partial template.

For the home page, they are index.html, _default/list.html, and _default/single.html. There are some rules that we’ll cover later that explain the names and paths. For now, just remember that Hugo couldn’t find a template for the home page and it told you so. At this point, you’ve got a working installation and site that we can build upon.

This is the file public/index.html. Hugo created a css/ directory. Hugo created a js/ directory. Hugo claimed that it created 0 pages. It created a file and copied over static files, but didn’t create any pages. That’s because it considers a “page” to be a file created directly from a content file. It doesn’t count things like the index.html files that it creates automatically. The Home Page Hugo supports many different types of templates. The home page is special because it gets its own type of template and its own template file. The file, layouts/index.html, is used to generate the HTML for the home page. The Hugo documentation says that this is the only required template, but that depends. Hugo’s warning message shows that it looks for three different templates: WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] If it can’t find any of these, it completely skips creating the home page. We noticed that when we built the site without having a theme installed. When Hugo created our theme, it created an empty home page template. Now, when we build the site, Hugo finds the template and uses it to generate the HTML for the home page. Since the template file is empty, the HTML file is empty, too. If the template had any rules in it, then Hugo would have used them to generate the home page. $ find . -name index.html | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 20:21 ./public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 ./themes/zafta/layouts/index.html $ The Magic of Static Hugo does two things when generating the site. It uses templates to transform content into HTML and it copies static files into the site. Unlike content, static files are not transformed. They are copied exactly as they are. Hugo assumes that your site will use both CSS and JavaScript, so it creates directories in your theme to hold them. Remember opinions? Well, Hugo’s opinion is that you’ll store your CSS in a directory named css/ and your JavaScript in a directory named js/. If you don’t like that, you can change the directory names in your theme directory or even delete them completely. Hugo’s nice enough to offer its opinion, then behave nicely if you disagree. $ find themes/zafta -type d | xargs ls -ld drwxr-xr-x 7 quoha staff 238 Sep 29 17:38 themes/zafta drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/archetypes drwxr-xr-x 5 quoha staff 170 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/partials drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/static drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/static/css drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/static/js $ ","date":"28-09-2014","objectID":"/en/posts-old/creating-a-new-theme/:4:3","tags":["themes"],"title":"Creating a New Theme","uri":"/en/posts-old/creating-a-new-theme/"},{"categories":["Blog"],"content":"The Theme Development Cycle When you’re working on a theme, you will make changes in the theme’s directory, rebuild the site, and check your changes in the browser.

Return to step 4. I’ll throw in one more opinion: never work on a theme on a live site. Always work on a copy of your site. Make changes to your theme, test them, then copy them up to your site.

That engine scans the template files for commands which are enclosed between “{{” and “}}”. In our template, the commands are: range .Title end The “range” command is an iterator. We’re going to use it to go through the first ten pages. Every HTML file that Hugo creates is treated as a page, so looping through the list of pages will look at every file that will be created. The “.Title” command prints the value of the “title” variable. Hugo pulls it from the front matter in the Markdown file. The “end” command signals the end of the range iterator. The engine loops back to the top of the iteration when it finds “end.” Everything between the “range” and “end” is evaluated every time the engine goes through the iteration. In this file, that would cause the title from the first ten pages to be output as heading level one. It’s helpful to remember that some variables, like .Data, are created before any output files. Hugo loads every content file into the variable and then gives the template a chance to process before creating the HTML files.

The posts themselves are still empty, but let’s take a moment to appreciate what we’ve done. Your template now generates output dynamically. Believe it or not, by inserting the range command inside of those curly braces, you’ve learned everything you need to know to build a theme. All that’s really left is understanding which template will be used to generate each content file and becoming familiar with the commands for the template engine. And, if that were entirely true, this tutorial would be much shorter. There are a few things to know that will make creating a new template much easier. Don’t worry, though, that’s all to come.

That means that their section is “post” (and if we don’t do something weird, their type is also “post”). Hugo uses the section and type to find the template file for every piece of content. Hugo will first look for a template file that matches the section or type name. If it can’t find one, then it will look in the _default/ directory. There are some twists that we’ll cover when we get to categories and tags, but for now we can assume that Hugo will try post/single.html, then _default/single.html. Now that we know the search rule, let’s see what we actually have available: $ find themes/zafta -name single.html | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 132 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html We could create a new template, post/single.html, or change the default. Since we don’t know of any other content types, let’s start with updating the default. Remember, any content that we haven’t created a template for will end up using this template. That can be good or bad. Bad because I know that we’re going to be adding different types of content and we’re going to end up undoing some of the changes we’ve made. It’s good because we’ll be able to see immediate results. It’s also good to start here because we can start to build the basic layout for the site. As we add more content types, we’ll refactor this file and move logic around. Hugo makes that fairly painless, so we’ll accept the cost and proceed. Please see the Hugo documentation on template rendering for all the details on determining which template to use. And, as the docs mention, if you’re building a single page application (SPA) web site, you can delete all of the other templates and work with just the default single page.

The front matter of our posts has a variable named “date.” It’s usually the date the content was created, but let’s pretend that’s the value we want to display.

The template code will look like: {{ .Date.Format \"Mon, Jan 2, 2006\" }} Posts use the default single template, so we’ll change that file. $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html {{ partial \"header.html\" . }} \u003ch1\u003e{{ .Title }}\u003c/h1\u003e \u003ch2\u003e{{ .Date.Format \"Mon, Jan 2, 2006\" }}\u003c/h2\u003e {{ .Content }} {{ partial \"footer.html\" . }} :wq Generate the web site and verify the results. The posts now have the date displayed in them. There’s a problem, though. The “about” page also has the date displayed. As usual, there are a couple of ways to make the date display only on posts. We could do an “if” statement like we did on the home page. Another way would be to create a separate template for posts. The “if” solution works for sites that have just a couple of content types. It aligns with the principle of “code for today,” too. Let’s assume, though, that we’ve made our site so complex that we feel we have to create a new template type. In Hugo-speak, we’re going to create a section template. Let’s restore the default single template before we forget. $ mkdir themes/zafta/layouts/post $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html {{ partial \"header.html\" . }} \u003ch1\u003e{{ .Title }}\u003c/h1\u003e {{ .Content }} {{ partial \"footer.html\" . }} :wq Now we’ll update the post’s version of the single template. If you remember Hugo’s rules, the template engine will use this version over the default. $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/post/single.html {{ partial \"header.html\" . }} \u003ch1\u003e{{ .Title }}\u003c/h1\u003e \u003ch2\u003e{{ .Date.Format \"Mon, Jan 2, 2006\" }}\u003c/h2\u003e {{ .Content }} {{ partial \"footer.html\" . }} :wq Note that we removed the date logic from the default template and put it in the post template. Generate the web site and verify the results. Posts have dates and the about page doesn’t.

Part of the art of a good template is knowing when to add a new template and when to update an existing one. While you’re figuring that out, accept that you’ll be doing some refactoring. Hugo makes that easy and fast, so it’s okay to delay splitting up a template.
